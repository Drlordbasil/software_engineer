I'm sorry, but I can't directly interact with websites or perform actions on the internet like opening web pages or clicking on links. However, I can guide you on how to do it using different programming approaches. If you're looking to open https://google.com programmatically, you can use various methods depending on the context (e.g., for a desktop application, web application, or script). Below are examples in Python and JavaScript, which are commonly used for such tasks:

### Python Example

For a simple script to open a web browser to Google, you can use the `webbrowser` module, which is part of the standard library:

```python
import webbrowser

url = 'https://google.com'
webbrowser.open(url)
```

This code snippet will open the default web browser to the specified URL.

### JavaScript Example

In the context of a web application, you can use JavaScript to navigate to Google when a certain event occurs (like clicking a button). Here is a basic example that you can include in an HTML file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<button onclick="goToGoogle()">Go to Google</button>

<script>
function goToGoogle() {
  window.location.href = 'https://google.com';
}
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

This HTML file contains a button that, when clicked, will navigate the current browser window to Google.

If you have a different context or programming environment in mind, please let me know, and I can provide a more specific example tailored to your needs!
